# IMDB-Data-Analytics-SQL-Based-Project


Domain: Media Analytics
Objective: Analyzed an IMDB-like relational database using SQL to derive actionable insights on movie trends, data quality, and key performance metrics.

Key Contributions:
•	Data Exploration & Cleaning:
      o	Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) on multi-table datasets to evaluate structure and completeness.
      o	Identified and handled null values in critical fields (e.g., country, gross income, languages) using SQL case expressions.
•	Trend Analysis:
      o	Analyzed yearly and monthly trends in movie releases using time-series analysis techniques.
      o	Extracted insights on average movie durations and income distribution across genres.
•	SQL Querying & Optimization:
      o	Developed and optimized complex SQL queries involving joins, subqueries, and aggregations for multi-table analysis.
      o	Implemented database queries to compute metrics such as row counts, missing data patterns, and release trends.
•	Data Preparation for Reporting:
      o	Prepared cleaned and summarized data for dashboards and reports, ensuring accuracy and usability for stakeholders.
      
Results:
•	Delivered insights into movie release trends and identified data quality issues for actionable recommendations.
•	Created a database-ready dataset, enabling further analysis and visualizations.
